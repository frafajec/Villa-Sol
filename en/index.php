    <h4>LITTLE VILLAGE OF KANICA</h4>

            It is a little place near Rogoznica, situated in a beautiful bay with beaches to everyone’s taste – shallow sandy beaches, 
            gravel or rocky ones. Immersed in stunning nature, no other settlements surrounding it, Kanica provides isolation from busy 
            everyday life, and yet it is very near attractive tourist destinations. Thanks to its particular geographic location, it 
            has a great microclimate with lots of sunny days and no strong winds. Crystal clear blue sea lets your imagination take you 
            to far away beaches. This magical atmosphere can really provide relaxation and peace, and it invites you to come back.
